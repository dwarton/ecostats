\description{
Data from a study of the effect of offshore wind farms on fish communities 
(Bergström et al. 2013), with measurements before (2003) and after (2010) wind 
farm installation at 36 different sites in three zones -- two affected by wind farms,
and two control zones. Abundances have been recorded for 16 different taxa.
