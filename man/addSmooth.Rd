\title{addSmooth Add a smoother to a plot, with pointwise confidence band}
\usage{
addSmooth(
  X,
  Y,
  conf.level = 0.05,
  line.col = "slateblue4",
  envelope.col = adjustcolor(line.col, alpha.f = 0.1),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conf.level}{the confidence level to use in constructing the confidence band around the smoother.}

\item{line.col}{color of smoother. Defaults to "slateblue4".}

\item{envelope.col}{color of the global envelope around the expected trend. All data points should always stay within this envelope
(and will for a proportion \code{conf.level} of datasets satisfying model assumptions). If a smoother has been used on
the residual vs fits or scale-location plot, the envelope is constructed around the smoother, that is, the smoother should always stay
within the envelope.}

\item{...}{further arguments sent through to \code{lines} and \code{polygon}.}

\item{x}{is the \code{x} co-ordinates for the plot, _e.g._ the fitted values in a plot of residuals vs fitted values.}

\item{y}{is the \code{y} co-ordinates for the plot}
}
\value{
A smoother is added to the existing plot, with confidence band. In addition, a data frame is invisibly
returned with the following components:\describe{
\item{\code{X}}{The values of \code{x} at which the smoother is evaluated.}
\item{\code{Yhat}}{Values of the smoother used to predict \code{y}, for each value of \code{x}.}
\item{\code{Yhi}}{The upper bound on the confidence band, for each value of \code{x}.}
\item{\code{Ylo}}{The lower bound on the global envelope, for each value of \code{x}.}
}
}
\description{
Adds a smoother to a plot of \code{y} against \code{x}, and a confidence band around the smoother with pointwise coverage
(*not* global, unlike \code{\link{plotenvelope}}). The smoother is constructed using \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}
and confidence bands use Wald intervals, extracting the standard error from \code{\link[mgcv]{predict.gam}}.
}
\details{
A challenge when interpreting diagnostic plots is understanding the extent to which
deviations from the expected pattern could be due to random noise (sampling variation)
rather than actual assumption violations. This function is intended to assess this, 
by simulating multiple realizations of residuals (and fitted values) in situations where 
assumptions are satisfied, and plotting a global simulation envelope around these at level \code{conf.level}.

This function adds a smoother to a plot of \code{y} against \code{x} using \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}, and a confidence band 
around the smoother with pointwise coverage (*not* global, unlike \code{\link{plotenvelope}}) using Wald intervals
that take the standard error of predicted values from \code{\link[mgcv]{predict.gam}}.

When constructing a plot to diagnose model fit, \code{\link{plotenvelope}} is preferred, because this constructs
simulation envelopes globally, simplifying interpretation, and tends to give more accurate envelopes, via simulation.
This function is intended to fit trends to data for descriptive purposes, but it could be used (with caution) 
to diagnose model fit in residual plots in situations where \code{\link{plotenvelope}} is unavailable.
