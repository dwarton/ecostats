#' Aphid data as a BACI design
#'
#' @description
#' A subset from a study of the effects of bird exclusion on biological control of aphids in oat fields in 
#' Germany (Grass \emph{et al.} 2017). Many thanks to Ingo for providing the raw data. The full data are
#' in \code{\link{aphids}, here we provide just two sampling times, 3 days and 30 days after netting.
#' OK, this is not quite a BACI design, 3 days after netting is not quite "before" but effects at this 
#' point should be negligible...
#' 
#' There were eight plots, four with plastic netting to exclude birds, and four without. Aphid abundance 
#' was counted on 5 shoots per plot. The expectation was that aphid numbers would decrease on bird 
#' exclusion, because an important food source to tree sparrows is aphid predators, hoverflies and 
#' ladybird beetles, so presence of birds may be limit the effectiveness of a biological control of aphids.
