Authors@R: c(person("David", "Warton", email = "david.warton@unsw.edu.au", role = c("aut", "cre")),
            person("Christopher", "Chung", role = "ctb"),

Description: Functions and data supporting the Eco-Stats text (Warton, 2022, Springer), and solutions to exercises. Functions include tools for using simulation envelopes in diagnostic plots, and a function for diagnostic plots of multivariate linear models. Datasets mentioned in the package are included here (where not available elsewhere) and vignette solutions to textbook exercises will be forthcoming at a later time.
